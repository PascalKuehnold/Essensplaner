    <string name="welcomeText">v0.4.7\nHey, thanks a lot for testing my App!\n\n
        The App is still in development and it could be possible that you may run into problems.\n\n
        If so, I would appreciate it if you could tell me where this problem occurred.\n
        Should you come across serious errors, such as the app crashing, please send me a message as well.\n
        Also it would be best if you can add where it happened and what you were exactly doing.\n\n
        Since the app is still under development, it is possible that larger parts of the backend side will change.\n
        Which may mean that the App needs to be reinstalled.\n\n
        All previously entered data will be deleted.\n
        Please be aware of this.\n\n
        If you have any suggestions or ideas to improve the App, please feel free to contact me.(This includes usability and appearance as well)\n\n
        Have fun testing!\n
        Pascal
